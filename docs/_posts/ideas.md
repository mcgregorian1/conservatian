# Ideas

Hi! My name is Ian and I'm a PhD student at NC State University. I'm a forest ecologist by training but I've temporarily traded my time under the trees to research them from above. I knew nothing about remote sensing before I started, but every day I learn a little bit more and become more comfortable combining the data with my previous experience, in order to better understand forest dynamics in a changing world.
